1.5. Wait until LB agar cools down and add 150 ul antibiotic stock solution (final concentration 50 ug/ml)
**Warning: if media will be too hot antibiotic may degrade**
*Note: check the temperature with the inside of your wrist, the flask should not scald the skin*
    
1.6. Pour liquid LB agar with antibiotic into 6 Petri dishes with serum pipette (25 ml per dish), cooldown the dishes on a horizontal surface 20-30' RT
*Note: for storage seal the dishes with parafilm and store at 4°C*

2.2. Add 0.5 ml of overnight culture into 8 ml of LB media in a conical flask, incubate 37°C 200 RPM 100-120' (OD600 0.35-0.4)
**Warning: next manipulations on the ice!**

2.3. Transfer cells into 8 1.5 ml epp., 1 ml per tube

2.4. CF 7000 RPM 5'

2.5. Discard supernatant and resuspend the cells in each tube in 0.5 ml ice-cold 0.1M CaCl2 work solution, collect suspension into 4x 1.5 ml epp., 1 ml per tube

2.6. Incubate cells on ice 20'

2.7. CF 7000 RPM 5'

2.8. Discard supernatant and resuspend the cells in each tube in 150 ul ice-cold 0.1M CaCl2 work solution

2.9. Collect suspension into 2x 1.5 ml epp., 300 ul per tube

*Note: keep competent cells on ice and use it as soon as possible*


### 3. Transformation

3.1. Add 1-100 ng of plasmid DNA and careful pipette suspension
**Warning: no more than 10 ul of plasmid solution per 300 ul cells aliquot!**

3.2. Incubate on ice 30'

3.3. Heat-shock by placing in 42°C water bath for 30-45"

3.4. Place cells on ice for 2'

3.5. Add 1 ml LM medium
*Note: LB medium should be prewormed to 37°C*

3.6. Incubate 37°C 200 RPM 1 h

3.7. Seed the cells in 1:10 and 1:100 dilutions on the Petri dish with LB agar + antibiotic
*Note: seed volume \~ 10-15 ul, spread cell suspension across agar surface with microbiological spreader*

3.8. Incubate 37°C 12-16 h
