*Note: keep competent cells on ice and use it as soon as possible*


### 3. Transformation

3.1. Unfreeze or take fresh prepare aliqute of competent cells.
*Note: unfreeze cells on ice*

3.2. Add 1-100 ng of plasmid DNA and careful pipette suspension.
**Warning: no more than 5 ul of plasmid solution per 200ul cells aliquot!**

3.3. Incubate on ice 30'.

3.4. Heat-shock by placing in 42°C water bath for 30-45".

3.5. Place cells on ice for 2'.

3.6. Add 1 ml LM medium.
*Note: LB medium should be prewormed to 37oC*

3.7. Incubate 37oC 200 RPM \~ 1 h.

3.8. Seed the cells in 1:10 and 1:100 dilutions on the Petri dish with LB agar + antibiotic.
*Note: seed volume \~ 10-15 ul, spread cell suspension across agar surface with microbiological spreader*

3.9. Incubate 37oC 12-16 h.
