=================================
*Borys Olifirov, 21.07.2020*

Protocol for cryoconservation of the HEK 293 cells culture.
*Note: reagents volume for ONE 25 cm2 culture flask with >85% confluency*

## Protocol
### 0. Liquid nitrogen preparation
0.1. Prepare Dewar's vessel and fill it up with liquid nitrogen to a third of its volume.

**Warning: wear protective gloves when working with liquid nitrogen**
**Warning: DO NOT  close Dewar's vessel tightly!**

### 1. Preparation

1.1. Clean the Biological Safety Cabinet (BSC) work surface using 70% ethanol in sprayer

1.2. Check for required equipment and reagents (tables below):

| **Equipment**       | Description                  | Note                             |

| Pipette             | 5 ml, 1 ml                   |                                  |
| Tips                | 5 ml, 1 ml (blue)            |                                  |
| Eppendorf tubes     | 1.5 ml                       | DNA-free sterile tubes           |
| Cryotube            | 1.5 ml                       | sterile tubes                    |
| Racks for tubes     |                              | for eppendorf and falcon tubes   |
| Gloves              |                              |                                  |
| Waste glass         | 50-100 ml chemical glass     | for waste                        |


| **Reagent**          | Description                      | Note                                         |
|----------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| DMEM+                | DMEM with FBS ans Gent.          | take aliquot from a fridge                   |
| DMEM-                | DMEM without serum & antibiotics | take aliquot from a fridge                   |
| Typsin-EDTA          |                                  | take aliquot from a fridge                   |
| FBS                  |                                  | take aliquot from a fridge                   |
| DMSO                 | 100% solution                    | preheat at RT before use                     |

1.3. Take DMEM+ and Trypsin-EDTA aliquots from a fridge and put it into thermostat for ~ 1 h
*Note: culture mediums should be preheated to 37oC*

1.4. Put equipment into the BSC
    
1.5. Start BSC sterilization by 15-20 min UV

**Warning: DO NOT stare at UV light even trough the glass**
**Warning: DO NOT DMEM+, DMEM- and FBS to UV light**

### 2. Cryoconsevation
2.1. Take reagents from a thermostat and DMSO aliquot, clean all tubes with 70% ethanol from sprayer, place it into BSC

2.2. Remove all old medium from a flask

2.3. Add 1 ml of Trypsin-EDTA to a flask and wash cells 

2.4. Add 2.5 ml of Trypsin-EDTA

2.5. Incubation 3' in CO2-incubator

2.6. Add 1.5 ml of DMEM+ in flask

*Note: gently mix cell suspension*

2.7. Transfer cell suspension into 4x1.5 ml eppendorfs by 1 ml

2.8. CF 3000 RPM 3'

2.9. Remove supernatant from each eppendorf and resuspend cells in 250 ul CryoDMEM

**Warning: CryoDMEM should be cold (+4), place it to the work area from fridge directly before resuspending**

2.10. Transfer all cells suspension into cryotubes

*Note: aliquote cells suspension into one (1 ml) or two (by 0.5 ml) cryotubes*

2.11. Freeze the cells in nitrogen vapor in 2 h and then transfer tubes to cryobank

*Note: we use non-woven fabric bag that fix on inner side of the Dewar's vessel cap*
**Warning: DO NOT  close Dewar's vessel tightly!**
