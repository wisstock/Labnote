===============================

*Borys Olifirov, 5.08.2020*

Protocol for emergency decontamination HEK 293 culture. To remove potential contamination (particles in the medium, but without changing the color of the medium).

**Warning: now approved for HEK 293 cells only!**

## Protocol
### 1. Preparation

1.1. Clean the Biological Safety Cabinet (BSC) work surface using 70% ethanol in sprayer

1.2. Check for required equipment and reagents (tables below):

| **Equipment**       | Description                  | Note                                        |

| Tips                | 5 ml (white), 1 ml (blue)    |                                             |
| Waste glass         | 50-100 ml chemical glass     | for waste                                   |


| **Reagent**              | Description                      | Note                                                               |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| DMEM+                    | standard culture medium          | take tube with aliquot from a fridge                               |
| DMEM-                    | DMEM without serum & antibiotics | take tube with aliquot from a fridge                               |
| Gentamicin solution      | 10 mg/ml                         | standard antibiotic stock solution                                 |

1.3. Take aliquot with DMEM+ and DMEM- from a fridge and clean the tubes with 70% ethanol from sprayer. Put it into thermostat for ~ 1 h

*Note: culture mediums should be preheated to 37oC*


1.4. Put equipment into the BSC
    
1.5. Start BSC sterilization by 15-20 min UV

**Warning: DO NOT stare at UV light even trough the glass**

**Warning: DO NOT expose gentamicin to UV light**


### 2. Decontamination

2.1. Take culture dish/flask from CO2-incubator and put it to the BSC work surface

2.2. Remove all medium, tilt dish/flask to remove as much medium as possible

2.3. Add 0.5 ml Gentamicin solution and gently swirl the culture dish/flask 20-30 s to distribute the antibiotic solution evenly over the cells

2.4. Remove Gentamicin solution

2.5. Wash the cells 2-4 times with 1 ml DMEM-

*Note: under the action of gentamicin the medium becomes yellow, second portion of DMEM- shouldn't change the colour. Otherwise you should wash cells one more time*

2.6. Add fresh DMEM+ and return cells to the CO2-incubator. Return DMEM+ aliquot to the fridge

2.10. Put all equipments in its place and clean the BSC work surface using 70% ethanol, don't forget turn off the BSC
