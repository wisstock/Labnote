*Borys Olifirov, 18.09.2020*


**NP-EGTA AM** loading and Ca2+ uncaging in the HEK 293 cells culture.

*Note: all values for ONE well of the 12-well culture plate/18 mm cover glass*

## Protocol
### 0. Solutions preparation

*Note: —Åheck for old aliquotes before opening a new ampule*

0.1. Open one 5 ml ampule of the H2O free DMSO and prepare 25x200 ul aliquots (you should use full ampule volume)
**Warning: store all aliquotes in a hermetic container with H2O absorbing material (silica gel) at RT**

|Chemical   |ID               |MW (g/mol)|Stock Solution|Concentration|For one tube|
|-----------|-----------------|----------|--------------|-------------|------------|
|NP-EGTA AM |Mol. Prob. N-6803|789.70    |solid         |5 mM         |50 ug       |
|DMSO       |Sigma D2650      |78.13     |100% H20 free |-            |12.7 ul     |

0.2. Aliquot by 2 ul in 0.5 ml eppendorf tube (6 aliquotes)
*Note: store at <-10oC, store unfrozen aliquot at +4oC no longer then week*
**Warning: keep away from light!**
**Warning: NOT recommend refreeze an aliquot**
**Warning: preheat the tube 10-15 min at RT before opening, this prevent water condensation inside the tube**

1.3. Put equipment into the BSC
    
1.4. Start BSC sterilization by 15-20 min UV
**Warning: DO NOT stare at UV light even trough the glass**
**Warning: DO NOT expose NP-EGTA to UV light**

1.5. Prepare aliquot of an Outside Solution and add glucose (Mr = 180.2 g/mol) to concentration 10 mM and 
heat the solution to RT
*Note: for one experiment with  ~2 ml imaging chamber, 10 ml (18 mg of glucose) of Outside Solution will be enough*


### 2. Loading solution preparation

2.1. Add 0.5 ul NP-EGTA AM solution (final concentration of 5 uM) to 1.5 ml eppendorf
**Warning: preheat the tube 10-15 min at RT and vortex before use. DMSO melting temperature is 18.5oC**

2.2. Add 1 ul pluronic acid solution
**Warning: preheat the tube 20-30' at 35-40oC in thermostat**

2.3. Add 500 ul Outside Solution and pippete around 20 times
**Warning: add compounds dissolved in DMSO first otherwise they may not be dissolved properly in water**


### 3. Loading

3.1. Take 12-well culture plate from CO2-incubator and choose the well for preparation using inverted microscope

3.2. Put culture plate to the BSC work surface

3.3. Sterilize tweezers using 96% ethanol: dip tweezers tip into alcohol, burn it and wait until it goes out. Carefully, put tweezers from the work surface
**Warning: DO NOT dip burning tweezers in flask with ethanol!**
*Note: don't touch the work surface with a tweezers tip*

3.4. Open the culture plate and grab the cover glass over the edge with tweezers, transfer it to Petri dish adding loading solution
**Warning: cover glass should be covered with a loading solution**
*Note: try to transfer the glass as quickly as possible and don't damage the cell monolayer*

3.5. Put culture medium from the well into waste glass and close the culture plate, back it to the CO2-incubator

3.6. Place petri dish into CO2-incubator, load at 37oC for 37-40 min

3.7. Wash cells after loading to eliminate further loading by 1.5 ml of the Outside Solution

3.8. Leave for 10-15 min for complete deesterification
