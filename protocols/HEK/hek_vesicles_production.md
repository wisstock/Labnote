=================================
*Borys Olifirov, 4.11.2020*

Protocol for production of HEK 293 cells plasma membrane vesicles with chloride salts (*based on Piccolo et. al., 2012, doi:10.1021/ac301776j*).
**Warning: reagents volume for ONE well of the 24-wells plate with 70-90% confluency**

## Protocol
### 0. Solutions preparation
0.1. Prepare Vesiculation Buffer (*cho_vesiculation_buffer.csv*)

0.2. Prepare 30% Phosphate-buffer Saline/PBS 

*Note: dilute PBS to 30% using deionized water*

0.3. Sterilize all solutions by filtration through a syringe filter with 0.22 um pore size

*Note: aliquote solutions and store it at +4 oC*


### 1. Preparation
1.1. Clean the Biological Safety Cabinet (BSC) work surface using 70% ethanol in sprayer

1.2. Check for required equipment and reagents (tables below):

| **Equipment**       | Description                  | Note                             |
|---------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Pipette             | 1 ml                         |                                  |
| Tips                | 1 ml (blue)                  |                                  |
| Racks for tubes     |                              | for falcon tubes                 |
| Gloves              |                              |                                  |
| Waste glass         | 50-100 ml chemical glass     | for waste                        |


| **Reagent**          | Description                                     | Note                      |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Vesiculation Buffer  | chloride salts solution for vesicles production | take aliquot from a fridge|
| 30% PBS              | buffered salt solution                          | take aliquot from a fridge|

1.3. Take Vesiculation Buffer and 30% PBS aliquots from a fridge and put it outside the BSC for \~30-40'

*Note: solutions should be preheated at RT*

1.4. Put equipment into the BSC
    
1.5. Start BSC sterilization by 15-20 min UV

**Warning: DO NOT stare at UV light even trough the glass**
**Warning: DO NOT DMEM+, DMEM- and FBS to UV light**


### 2. Vesiculation
2.1. Clean all tubes with 70% ethanol from sprayer, place it into BSC

2.2. Take 24-well culture plate from CO2-incubator and choose the well for preparation using inverted microscope

*Note: choose wells with 70-90% confluency*
*Note: wait 24-36 h after transfection before vesiculating*
*Note: vesiculate cells right after AM-form loading protocol*

2.3. Rinse well with 0.5 ml 30% PBS and incubate cells 1' at RT

2.4. Repeat rinsing

2.5. Add 250 ul Vesiculation Buffer to well

2.6. Place plate into CO2-incubator, incubate 13 h at 37 oC


### 3. Preparing to imaging
3.1.
