Transfection of primary hippocampal neurons culture with Lipofectamine 2000 without medium replacement
=================================================

*Borys Olifirov, 03.2024*

**Warning: suitable for young neurons only (DIV 5-7)**

Protocol for **Lipofectamine 2000** transfection of the primary hippocampal neurons culture (5-10 DIV), based on [Tanaka et al., 2013](https://www.nature.com/articles/nprot.2013.171).

*Note: all values for ONE well of the 12-wells culture plate*


## Protocol
### 1. Preparation

1.1. Clean the Biological Safety Cabinet (BSC) work surface using 70% ethanol in sprayer

1.2. Check for required equipment and reagents (tables below):

| **Equipment**   | Description                                 | Note                                     |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Pipette         | 1 ml, 200 ul, 10 ul                         |                                          |
| Tips            | 1 ml (blue), 200 ul (yellow), 10 ul (white) |                                          |
| Eppendorf tubes | 1.5 ml                                      | DNA-free sterile tubes                   |
| Racks for tubes |                                             | for eppendorf tubes and for falcon tubes |
| Gloves          |                                             |                                          |
| Waste glass     | 50-100 ml chemical glass                    | for waste                                |


| **Reagent**        | Description                        | Note                                         |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| MEM-               | medium without serum & antibiotics | take tube with aliquot from a fridge         |
| Lipofectamine 2000 | invitrogen 11668-027               |                                              |
| Plasmid DNA        | DNA aliquot for transfection       | check DNA concentration before transfection! |

1.3. Put equipment into the BSC
    
1.4. Start BSC sterilization by 15-20 min UV

**Warning: DO NOT expose DNA and Lipofectamine to UV light**

**Warning: NEVER freeze Lipofectamin, store it only at 4Â°C**

### 2. Transfection
2.1. Take two 75 ul aliqoutes of MEM- into 1.5 ml eppendorf tubes

2.2. Add 2 ul of Lipofectamine 2000 into one MEM- aliquote, vortex 5-10" or resuspend  5-10 times

2.3. Incubate 10' RT

2.4. Add an appropriate amount of plasmid DNA into second MEM- aliquote, vortex 5-10" or resuspend  5-10 times

*Note: 0.3-1 ug of plasmid DNA is optimal range*

2.5. Add whole volume of MEM- with plasmid DNA into MEM- with Lipofectamine, vortex 5-10" or resuspend  5-10 times

2.6. Incubate 20' RT

2.7. Take 12-wells culture plate from CO2-incubator and place it in the BSC

2.8. Add whole volume of transfection mix intro selected well drop by drop   

2.9. Return the plate to CO2-incubator

2.12. Put all equipments in its place and clean the BSC work surface using 70% ethanol, don't forget turn off the BSC

*Note: you should use cells during 24-48 h days after transfection*
