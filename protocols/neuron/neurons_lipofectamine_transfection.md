Protocol for **Lipofectamine 2000** transfection of the primary hippocampal neurons culture (5-20 DIV).

*Note: all volumes for suitable for __ONE__ well of 12-well culture plate / 35 mm Petri dish*


## Protocol
### 1. Preparation

1.1. Clean the Biological Safety Cabinet (BSC) work surface using 70% ethanol in sprayer

1.2. Check for required equipment and reagents (tables below):

| **Equipment**   | Description                                 | Note                   |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Pipette         | 1 ml, 200 ul, 20 ul, 10 ul/2.5 ul           |                        |
| Tips            | 1 ml (blue), 200 ul (yellow), 10 ul (white) |                        |
| Eppendorf tubes | 1.5 ml                                      | DNA-free sterile tubes |
| Racks for tubes |                                             | for eppendorf tubes    |
| Gloves          |                                             |                        |
| Waste glass     | 50-100 ml chemical glass                    | for waste              |


| **Reagent**        | Description                     | Note                                             |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| MEM+               | standard culture medium         | stock stored at 4째C                              |
| MEM-               | MEM without serum & antibiotics | stock stored at 4째C                              |
| Lipofectamine 2000 | invitrogen 11668-027            | NEVER freeze Lipofectamin. store it at 4째C only! |
| Plasmid DNA        | DNA aliquot for transfection    | check DNA concentration before transfection!     |



1.3. Put equipment into the BSC
    
1.4. Start BSC sterilization by 15-20 min UV

**Warning: DO NOT expose DNA and Lipofectamine to UV light**

### 2. Transfection

2.1. Take 0.5 ml aliquot of MEM+ from a media stock and, put MEM+ aliquot into CO2-incubator/thermostat

*Note: MEM+ should be  preheated to 37째C*

2.2. Take 12-well culture plate from CO2-incubator and MEM- aliquot from thermostat. Place them into the BSC

2.3. Open the culture plate and transfer a half of medium volume (~ 0.5 ml) from selected well  to 1.5 eppendorf tube

*Note: try to replace the medium as quickly as possible*

*Note: place removed old media to CO2-incubator/thermostat for feature use*

2.4. Close the culture plate and back it to the CO2-incubator

2.5. Add 75 ul of MEM- into two 1.5 ml eppendorf tubes

*Note: MEM- should be at RT, but a small volume quickly heats up with the warmth of  hands*

2.6. Add 3 ul of Lipofectamine 2000 into one MEM- aliquot

2.7. Incubate 5' RT

2.8. Add appropriate volume of plasmid DNA solution into second MEM- aliquot

_Note: usually we use 0.3 - 1.5 ug of DNA per well / 35 mm Petri dish_

_Note: to save time, DNA solution preparation can continue throughout Lipofectamine 2000 incubation_

2.9. Add whole volume of DNA solution into Lipjfectamine 2000 solution, mix well with pipetting

2.10. Incubate 20' RT

2.11. Take 12-well culture plate from CO2-incubator and place it in the BSC

2.12. Add whole volume of transfection solution to selected well drop by drop  

2.13. Return the plate to CO2-incubator and incubate 3-5 h

2.14. Take 12-well culture plate from CO2-incubator and place it in the BSC.

2.15. Replace medium in transfected well with mix of 0.5 ml old MEM+ and 0.5 ml of fresh MEM+, return the plate to CO2-incubator

*Note: adding old MEM+ medium promotes neuronal survival by preserving growth factors produced by glial cells*

2.16. Put all equipments in its place and clean the BSC work surface using 70% ethanol, don't forget turn off the BSC

_Note: cells should be examined in 24-72h after transfection_
