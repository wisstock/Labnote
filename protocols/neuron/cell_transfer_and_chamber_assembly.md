=========================================================================

Protocol for preparing the hippocampal neurons cell culture to the electrophysiology experiments.

Borys Olifirov, 2020

## Protocol:
### 1. Preparation

1.1. Prepare aliquot of a Outside Solution what qualified for your experiment and add glucose (Mr = 180.2 g/mol) to concentration 10 mM and 
warm the solution to room temperature

*Note: for an experiment lasting 5-6 hours and one sample chamber volume of ~2 ml, 10 ml (18 mg of glucose) of Outside Solution will be enough*

1.2. Clean the Biological Safety Cabinet (BSC) work surface using 70% ethanol in sprayer

1.3. Check for required equipment (table below):


| Tool       | Description                  | Note                                        | 
|------------|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Pipette    | 1 ml                         |                                             |
| Tips       | 1 ml                         |                                             |
| Petri dish | D=30 mm                      | rinse with distilled water twice            |
| Tweezers   |                              |                                             |
| Ethanol    | 96%                          | for tweezers sterilization                  |
| Lighter    |                              | for ethanol burning                         |


1.4. Put tools and equipment into the BSC
    
1.5. Start BSC sterilization by 15-20 min UV

**Warning: DO NOT stare at UV light even trough the glass**


### 2. Cover glasses transfer
    
2.1. Take 12-well culture plate from CO2-incubator and choose the well for preparation using inverted microscope

2.2. Put culture plate to the BSC work surface

2.3. Sterilize tweezers using 96% ethanol: dip tweezers tip into alcohol, burning it and wait until it goes out. Put tweezers without touching it tip with the work surface.

**Warning: DO NOT dip burning tweezers in flac with ethanol! If ethanol in the flac ignites, just cover the throat of the flac with a cap**

2.4. Open the culture plate and put 500 ul medium from selected well into the Petri dish

2.5. Grab the cover glass over the edge with tweezers and transfer it to Petri dish

**Warning: DO NOT mix sides of the cover glass**

*Note: try to replace the medium as quickly as possible and be careful don't damage the cell monolayer*

2.6. Put else 500 ul medium into the Petri dish

2.7. Close the culture plate and back it to the CO2-incubator

2.8. Sterilize tweezers again and put all equipments in its place

2.9. At the end clean the BSC work surface using 70% ethanol and don't forget turn off the BSC

### 3. Osmolarity transfer

3.1. Add 3 ul of DL-AP5 Stock Solution (70 mM S.S.) to the dish with cover glass and gently mix contents

*Note: DL-AP5 is the NMDA-channels antagonist, used for decreasing excitotoxicity*

3.2. Replace a culture medium to the Outside Solution step by step to decrease osmotic shock:

|  remove vol.  |  add vol.  |  Incubation time  |
|---------------|------------|-------------------|
|      -        |  500 ul    |  10 min           | 
|  500 ul       |  700 ul    |  10 min           |
|  700 ul       |  1 ml      |  10 min           |

*Note: after the last step of the solution transfer, cells can stay at the dish for long time,  just replace ~1 ml of Outside Solution every 40 min - 1 hour*


### 4. Sample chamber assembly

4.1. Rinse parts of the chamber with distilled water and wipe them dry

4.2. Apply narrow band of the silicone grease around top side of the platform hole and bottom side of the bath hole

*Note: use for this manipulation tiny brush or toothpick and make sure that silicone band is smooth and unbreakable, it's important for hermetic state of the chamber*

**Warning: points below are special important, DO IT quickly and accurately**

4.3. By using tweezers get the cover glass from Petri dish and put it on the top of the platform hole. Glass should be right in the center of the hole

4.4. Apply ~ 0.3 ml of Outside Solution to the surface of cover glass

4.5. Install bath to the platform, move to the center sliding clamps and tighten the screws

4.6. Add ~ 1.5 ml of Outside solution to the bath and replace it after ~ 2 min

*Note: during stress cells release large amounts of calcium and we replace Outside Solution for decreasing excitotoxicity*

4.7. Replace Outside Solution every 40 min - 1 h and your cells will be alive approximately 5-6 h

*Note: optimal temperature for physiological experiments with cell culture is 18-25 oC*
