=================================================

*Borys Olifirov, 2020*

Protocol for **Lipofectamine 2000** transfection of the hippocampal neurons cell culture (12-20 DIV)

*Note: all values for TWO wells of the 12-well culture plate*




## Protocol
### 1. Preparation

1.1. Clean the Biological Safety Cabinet (BSC) work surface using 70% ethanol in sprayer

1.2. Check for required equipment and reagents (tables below):

| **Equipment**       | Description                  | Note                                        |
|---------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Pipette             | 1 ml, 200 ul, 20 ul          |                                             |
| Tips                | 1 ml (blue), 200 ul (yellow) |                                             |
| Eppendorf tubes     | 0.5 ml, 1 ml                 | DNA-free sterile tubes                      |
| Test tubes          | ~ 10-20 ml                   | sterile tubes for culture medium            |
| Racks for tubes     |                              | for eppendorf tubes and for falcon tubes    |
| Gloves              |                              |                                             |
| Waste glass         | 50-100 ml chemical glass     | for waste


| **Reagent**     | Description                     | Note                                         |
|-----------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| MEM+            | standard culture medium         | take tube with aliquot from a fridge         |
| MEM-            | MEM without serum & antibiotics | take tube with aliquot from a fridge         |
| Lipofectamine   | 1 ml (blue), 200 ul (yellow)    |                                              |
| Plasmid DNA     | DNA aliquot for transfection    | check DNA concentration before transfection! |

1.3. Take 2 ml aliquot with MEM+ and MEM- from a fridge and clean the tubes with 70% ethanol from sprayer. Put it into thermostat for ~ 1 h

*Note: culture mediums should be 
preheated to 37oC*

1.4. Put equipment into the BSC
    
1.5. Start BSC sterilization by 15-20 min UV

**Warning: DO NOT stare at UV light even trough the glass**

**Warning: DO NOT expose DNA and Lipofectamine to UV light**

### 2. Transfection

2.1. Take 12-well culture plate from CO2-incubator and MEM- aliquot from thermostat. Place them into the BSC

2.2. Open the culture plate and remove medium (~ 1 ml) from selected well and replace it with 1 ml MEM-. Repeat this actions for second well

*Note: try to replace the medium as quickly as possible*

2.3. Close the culture plate and back it to the CO2-incubator

2.4. Add 150 ul of MEM- into 0.5 ml eppendorf tube, then add an appropriate amount of plasmid DNA into tube. Gently vortex the tube for about 5 s

*Note: for 150 ul of MEM- 1 ug of plasmid DNA will be optimal amount*

2.5. Add 150 ul of MEM- into another 0.5 ml eppendorf tube, then add 7 ul of Lipofectamine 2000 into tube. Gently vortex the tube for about 5 s and wait 10 min. Return MEM- aliquot and Lipofectamine 2000 to the fridge

**Warning: NEVER freeze Lipofectamin, store it only at 4oC**

2.6. Add all MEM- with Lipofectamine to the tube with MEM- ans plasmid DNA. Gently vortex the tube for about 5 s and wait 12 min

2.7. Take 12-well culture plate from CO2-incubator and place it in the BSC.

*Note: vortex transfection solution just prior to addition to the wells*

2.8. Add 150 ul of transfection solution to each wells with MEM- medium. Gently swirl the culture plate 3-5 times to distribute the transfection solution evenly over the cells. Return the plate to CO2-incubator and wait 2 h

2.9. Take 12-well culture plate from CO2-incubator and place it in the BSC. Replace MEM- medium in transfected wells with MEM+ and return the plate to CO2-incubator. Return MEM+ aliquot to the fridge

*Note: try to replace the medium as quickly as possible*

2.10. Put all equipments in its place and clean the BSC work surface using 70% ethanol, don't forget turn off the BSC
