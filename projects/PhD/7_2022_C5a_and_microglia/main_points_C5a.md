C5a main points
---------------

### Pre
- What is a level of intrinsic spontaneous microglia activity in particular induced by the spinal cord extraction from mice?
- Whether C5a application can produce a significant and substantial increase (_change???_) in microglia activity in order to warrant our electrophysiological experiments?

### Tech
- Whether the level of intrinsic spontaneous microglia activity is increased due to the spinal cord extraction from mice over the time course of our electrophysiological experiments (30-60 min)?
- Whether perfusion via different syringes and BSA can produce significant changes in microglia activity?

### Gen
- How spatially C5a-dependent microglia activity is organized?
- Whether C5a-dependent microglia activity is mainly newly emerged or is it rather increase in frequency of previously spontaneous active sites?
- Is C5a-dependent microglia activity randomly distributed over FOV of rather concentrated in certain sites?
- Whether C5a-dependent microglia activity is mainly emerged in soma or processes of microglia cells?

### Rev
- What is a time course of C5a-induced microglia activity?
- Is there some desensitization of C5aRs?
- Is the effect of C5a washable?
