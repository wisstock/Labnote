Hippocalcin (HPCA) is a neuronal calcium sensor (NCS) protein responsible for modulating neuronal functions within the hippocampus. Upon binding with calcium ions, HPCA undergoes conformational changes, leading to highly heterogeneous insertions in the cellular membrane. Previous studies have indicated that the pattern of HPCA insertion in neurons corresponds to specific conservative regions (_Dovgan, unpublished_). Furthermore, HPCA exhibits a strong affinity for the minor phospholipid PIP2 with a dissociation constant (Kd) of approximately 50 nM (_[O'Callaghan et al., 2005](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16053445/)_). 

Under normal resting calcium concentrations in the cytoplasm, only a small fraction of HPCA localizes to the plasma membrane, ranging from 0% to 8% (_[Sheremet et al., 2020](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11062-020-09845-6)_; _Cherkas, unpublished_). However, in response to an influx of calcium ions, the insertions at specific plasma membrane sites can increase by 2-2.5 fold (_Olifirov, unpublished_; _Dovgan, unpublished_). 
It is important to note that HPCA's signaling potential targets, such as KCNQ potassium channels, voltage-gated calcium channels, and clathrin-mediated endocytosis machinery, are directly associated with PIP2 (_[Rodr√≠guez-Menchaca et al., 2012](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23055973/)_; _[Dickson et al., 2014](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24843134/)_; _[Jung & Haucke, 2007](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-0854.2007.00595.x)_). However, the exact mechanisms of molecular signaling in these instances remain unclear. The significant local concentration of HPCA in response to an increase in calcium concentration suggests that potential regulatory pathways may not solely involve direct protein-protein interactions. HPCA could also exert non-direct influences through the modification of local biophysical properties of the lipid bilayer and PIP2 buffering.

Primary dystonia is a neurological movement disorder characterized by repeated or prolonged muscle contractions and postural abnormalities. Genetic studies of patients with primary DYT2 dystonia have identified mutations in the HPCA gene as a causative factor in the disease (_[Charlesworth et al., 2015](https://www.cell.com/ajhg/fulltext/S0002-9297(15)00060-9)_). However, the precise mechanisms through which these mutations contribute to the development of movement disorders remain poorly understood. Previous studies conducted in our laboratory have revealed that the DYT2-associated mutant HPCA(N75K) demonstrates heterogeneous insertions that overlap with HPCA(WT) insertion sites. Nevertheless, mutant exhibits a significantly reduced insertions area and a markedly decreased affinity for calcium ions (_[Osypenko et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nbd.2019.104529)_).

The objective of this study is to investigate the biophysical aspects concerning the interaction between the composition of the plasma membrane, specifically the quantity of PIP2 within the membranes, and the biophysical characteristics of HPCA. This examination will focus on discerning differences between the wild-type HPCA and DYT2-associated mutant N75K. To achieve this, a combination of wet experiments conducted on HEK cells and molecular dynamic simulations will be employed.


## Research plan
Confocal live-cell imaging allows for the acquisition of optical sections of cells and the direct separation of cytoplasmic and plasma membrane regions in the images. By combining the FRAP approach (_[Sheremet et al., 2020](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11062-020-09845-6)_; _[Kitamura & Kinjo, 2017](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29450109/)_) with laser-induced calcium ion uncaging, we can estimate HPCA diffusion coefficients in both the cytoplasm and plasma membrane. Reproducing the diffusion coefficients of these proteins in the cytosol and in the membrane-bound state using molecular dynamics simulations will provide valuable insights into the HPCA microenvironment within cells.

The simulations will involve varying the composition of the lipid bilayer to test hypotheses about the proteins' preferential interactions with specific lipid species. Additionally, we will compare lateral diffusion coefficients for specific regions and their saturation with certain lipid types. This validation process will allow us to verify the accuracy of our computational models against experimental data and establish robust simulation pipelines for future investigations. In the prospect of analysis methods development, this part will allow inductively infer relaxation times for NCS and convergence steps needed to measure various system parameters.

Secondly, we plan to measure the free energy difference between calcium-bound protein membrane interaction and calcium-free protein membrane interaction using developed computational models. We can derive values from this parameter, which can be used for the purpose of fitting experimentally observable dose-dependence curve translocation of the HPCA to the membrane as a function of calcium concentration. To provide an experimental basis for our modeling approach, we will utilize live-cells confocal imaging with concurrent laser-induced calcium ion uncaging and calcium imaging.
